# BotOvh

BotOvh is a tiny bot I wrote for my personal needs. It checks whether a specific domain name is available for registration, and then automatically registers the domain using the [OVH API](https://github.com/ovh/python-ovh).

## Requirements

- **Python 3**

In addition to Python 3 itself, BotOvh uses the following module:

- **ovh**: OVH API wrapper ([GitHub](https://github.com/ovh/python-ovh))
  - Installation: `pip install ovh`
